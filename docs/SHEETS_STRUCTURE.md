## Creating the Sheet

### Step 1: Create Blank Google Sheet
1. Go to [sheets.google.com](https://sheets.google.com)
2. Click "+" to create a new sheet
3. Name it "WorldPulse MVP"

### Step 2: Copy Sheet ID
The Sheet ID is in the URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/{SHEET_ID}/edit`

### Step 3: Sheets Auto-Created
The Apps Script will automatically create all tabs with headers when you first call it.

### Step 4: (Optional) Pre-create Sheets
You can manually create the sheets first if you prefer:

1. Right-click sheet tab → "Insert 1 below"
2. Name: `Users`
3. Repeat for: `Matches`, `Feedback`, `Ideas`, `Stories`, `Roadmap`

The Apps Script headers will populate automatically on first use.

## Best Practices

1. **Don't Delete Headers** - The first row contains column names. Keep them intact.

2. **IDs are Auto-Generated** - Apps Script creates UUIDs automatically. Don't manually edit ID columns.

3. **Timestamps are Auto-Created** - The "Created" columns are auto-generated. Don't modify them.

4. **Votes are Numbers** - Keep vote columns as numbers, not text.

5. **Status Values** - Use exact status values:
   - Users: `active`, `inactive`
   - Matches: `pending`, `accepted`, `rejected`, `completed`
   - Training: `pending`, `approved`, `completed`

6. **Role Values** - Use exact role values: `mentor`, `peer`, `mentee`

7. **Focus Areas** - Use exact areas: `tech`, `business`, `health`

## API Connection

All data in these sheets is accessed via the Apps Script API endpoints. See [APPS_SCRIPT_CODE.gs](./APPS_SCRIPT_CODE.gs) for the complete API reference.

### Common Operations

```javascript
// Create user
const user = await fetch(API_BASE_URL, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    action: 'createUser',
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john@example.com',
    role: 'mentor'
  })
});

// Get all ideas
const ideas = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}?action=getIdeas`);

// Vote on story
const vote = await fetch(API_BASE_URL, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    action: 'voteStory',
    storyId: 'story-001'
  })
});
```

## Scaling Tips

As your app grows:

1. **Archive Old Data** - Move completed matches to an "Archive" sheet
2. **Add Indexes** - Use conditional formatting to highlight popular ideas
3. **Backup Regularly** - File → Version history keeps automatic backups
4. **Monitor Size** - Google Sheets has a ~10M cell limit
5. **Optimize Queries** - Apps Script queries all rows; filter in code for better performance

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Sheets not created | First API call creates them automatically. Check SHEET_ID is correct |
| API returns empty | Verify SHEET_ID is in the Apps Script configuration |
| Data not saving | Check user has edit access to the Google Sheet |
| Slow queries | Use filters in getUsers/getIdeas to limit returned data |
